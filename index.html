      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <hr />
      <p class=bio>I am an artist who works digitally, but I also enjoy working
        in traditional mediums such as printmaking, painting, and drawing.
        My goal with my artwork is to help people, bring comfort, find authenticity,
        and give the intersections of my many identities a place to live visually. I have
        a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Studio Art and Theatre from Florida
        University. I currently live in the Bay Area in California, USA. <br />
